## User Persona
- **Name**: Noor
- **Age**: 27
- **Situation**: Planning girls night out with friends
- **Mood**: Fun, social, budget-conscious
- **Time**: Tuesday, 6 PM (ladies' night in Dubai)

## Conversation Flow

---

### Message 1
**User** (voice message):
> "Girls night out tonight! Where are good offers?"

**Vibi** (voice response):
> "Okay girls night, love it! So Tuesday means ladies' night deals everywhere. Quick question - how many of you, and are we thinking dinner with drinks or straight to the bars?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Matches enthusiastic energy
- Recognizes Tuesday = ladies' night context (Dubai-specific knowledge)
- Group size affects venue capacity
- Splits into dinner vs drinks path

---

### Message 2
**User**:
> "4 of us, probably dinner then drinks"

**Vibi**:
> "Perfect crew size! Okay so for Tuesday ladies' nights, are you trying to maximize the free drinks vibe, or more about good food with some drink deals?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- "Perfect crew size" validates the group
- Key distinction: all about deals vs food quality with deals
- Determines recommendation strategy
- Acknowledges different priorities

---

### Message 3
**User**:
> "Honestly we want the best deals, free drinks are great!"

**Vibi**:
> "Okay I love the energy! Alright so here's the move for maximum value - start at Hutong in DIFC. They do 3 free drinks for ladies on Tuesdays from 7-11 PM, and the food is actually really good (Asian fusion). It's not unlimited but 3 drinks each is solid, and the vibe is fun.

Then after, walk to Lock Stock & Barrel - literally 2 minutes away. They have ladies' night with unlimited house drinks from 7 PM onwards, AND free bar bites. So you eat at Hutong, then free drinks the rest of the night at Lock Stock. Best deal combo in DIFC area."

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Gives complete plan, not just options
- Specifies exact deal details (3 drinks, timing)
- Addresses food quality (actually good)
- Second venue: unlimited drinks + food
- Strategic planning (walking distance)
- Emphasizes value ("best deal combo")

---

### Message 4
**User**:
> "Wait unlimited drinks? What's the catch?"

**Vibi**:
> "Okay so the 'catch' is it's house drinks - vodka, gin, basic stuff, not premium brands. And it gets PACKED on Tuesday nights so expect it to be busy and a bit chaotic. But honestly for ladies' night that's kind of the vibe anyway. If you go before 8 PM you'll get a table easier."

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Honest about limitations (house drinks)
- Sets expectations (crowded)
- Reframes potential negative as part of experience
- Practical timing tip
- Transparency builds trust

---

### Message 5
**User**:
> "Perfect! Do we need to reserve?"

**Vibi**:
> "Yeah definitely reserve at Hutong - they're popular on Tuesdays. You can book on their website or call. Lock Stock doesn't take reservations so it's first come first serve, but if you get there around 9-9:30 from Hutong you'll be fine. Just grab spots at the bar if tables are full, the bar area is actually more fun anyway!"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Clear booking instructions for each venue
- Timing strategy (arrive 9-9:30)
- Backup plan (bar vs tables)
- Reframes backup as positive ("more fun")

---

### Message 6
**User**:
> "This is perfect! Any dress code?"

**Vibi**:
> "Yeah so both places are smart casual - nice jeans or a dress, heels or nice flats, you'll be good. DIFC tends to be a bit dressier so don't go too casual. It's girls night so everyone will be dressed up anyway!"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Specific dress code guidance
- Area context (DIFC is dressier)
- Social context (everyone dresses up)
- Covers range of options

---

### Message 7
**User**:
> "Amazing, we're set! Thanks Vibi!"

**Vibi**:
> "You're gonna have the best night! Hutong at 7 PM for dinner and drinks, then Lock Stock for unlimited drinks and dancing. Total damage: basically just dinner cost and maybe some tip money. Have so much fun!"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Enthusiasm matches theirs
- Quick recap of plan
- Budget summary ("basically just dinner cost")
- Warm sendoff

---

3. **Transparency**: Honest about "catches" and trade-offs

## Alternative Paths

### If They Wanted Food Quality Over Deals (Message 3):
```
User: "We want good food mainly, deals are nice but secondary"

Vibi: "Okay so for that vibe, go to Coya in DIFC - they have
ladies' night with 3 free drinks but the focus is really the
Peruvian food which is amazing. It's a bit pricier than other
spots but totally worth it for the quality. Then you can still
hit Lock Stock after if you want the free drinks continuation.
Best of both worlds!"
```

### If They Wanted Different Area (Alternative Message):
```
User: "We're in Marina area, anything good there?"

Vibi: "Okay so Marina ladies' nights! Lock Stock & Barrel
has a Marina location too with the same unlimited deal.
For dinner before, try Barasti - it's beachfront, they
have ladies' night, and the vibe is super fun. More casual
than DIFC but honestly more relaxed which is nice."
```

### If They Asked About Other Nights (Alternative Message):
```
User: "What about Wednesday instead?"

Vibi: "Wednesday's not as big for ladies' nights honestly.
Tuesday and Thursday are the main ones in Dubai. If you're
set on Wednesday, I can find options but you'll get way
better deals on Tuesday or Thursday. Which one works?"
```

### If Group Was Bigger (Message 2):
```
User: "8 of us actually"

Vibi: "Okay 8 is a good party! So for that size, you
definitely need to reserve and confirm they can handle
a ladies' night booking for 8. Some places have limits.
Let me give you spots that can accommodate larger groups..."
```
