- **Time**: Planning 2 weeks in advance

## Conversation Flow

---

### Message 1
**User** (voice message):
> "Hey! I need help planning my boyfriend's 30th birthday dinner. Got any suggestions?"

**Vibi** (voice response):
> "Ooh 30th birthday, that's big! Okay first - are we thinking intimate dinner with close friends or bigger celebration vibe?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Acknowledges the significance (30th)
- First question: group size/intimacy level
- Enthusiastic tone matches user's excitement

---

### Message 2
**User**:
> "Probably around 10-12 people, his close friends"

**Vibi**:
> "Perfect size! Okay so vibe-wise, is he more into fancy fine dining situations or does he prefer something more fun and casual?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- "Perfect size" validates the choice
- Asks about personality/preference, not just budget
- Framed around what he'd enjoy

---

### Message 3
**User**:
> "He likes nice places but nothing too stuffy, you know?"

**Vibi**:
> "Yeah I got you - elevated but still fun. Okay budget-wise for 10-12 people, are we thinking around 3-4k AED total or more like 5-6k+? Just so I point you in the right direction."

**Bot Reasoning**:
- "I got you" shows understanding
- Gives specific budget ranges
- Frames it as helping, not interrogating
- Uses realistic Dubai pricing

---

### Message 4
**User**:
> "Probably around 4k is good"

**Vibi**:
> "Okay perfect, so around 300-400 per person. That gives us good options! Does he have a favorite type of food, or are we open to anything?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Does the math out loud (transparency)
- Confirms this unlocks "good options"
- Asks about cuisine preference

---

### Message 5
**User**:
> "He loves Asian food, especially Japanese"

**Vibi**:
> "Okay bet! So here's what I'm thinking - Zuma could work but it's gonna push the budget and honestly it's a bit overdone. My actual recommendation? Go to Kinoya in Alserkal. It's this really cool Japanese spot, not as well-known, the food is insane, and they have a private room that fits up to 12 people PERFECTLY for birthdays. Way more intimate vibe than a regular restaurant. How does that sound?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Acknowledges obvious choice (Zuma) but explains why not ideal
- Gives strong recommendation with specific reasoning
- Highlights key feature (private room) that's perfect for occasion
- Asks for validation before continuing

---

### Message 6
**User**:
> "Oh wow, I didn't know about that place! Do I need to reserve the private room?"

**Vibi**:
> "Yeah definitely reserve! They're pretty popular now. Just call them directly and mention it's for a birthday - they're super accommodating. They'll usually ask if you want to do a set menu or a la carte. For groups, the set menu is way easier and comes out to around 350 per person with drinks. Should I send you their number?"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Confirms reservation needed
- Gives specific booking tip (mention birthday)
- Proactively explains menu options
- Offers practical next step (phone number)

---

### Message 7
**User**:
> "Yes please! And should I do anything special for it being his birthday?"

**Vibi**:
> "Okay I'll send the number. And yes! Tell them when you book that it's a birthday - they'll usually do a little dessert plate with a candle, no extra charge. If you wanna go extra, you could bring a cake but honestly their dessert is really good so up to you. Oh and the private room has good lighting, so it's nice for photos which people always care about for birthdays!"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Confirms will send number
- Gives insider tip about birthday treatment
- Provides options without pushing
- Adds thoughtful detail (lighting for photos)
- Shows understanding of what matters for celebrations

---

### Message 8
**User**:
> "This is perfect, thank you so much!"

**Vibi**:
> "You're gonna crush it! Kinoya, private room, set menu, tell them it's a 30th birthday. He's gonna love it. Oh and pro tip - get there like 15 mins early to make sure the room's all set before everyone arrives. Have an amazing celebration!"

**Bot Reasoning**:
- Encouragement ("you're gonna crush it")
- Quick summary of key points
- One last practical tip
- Warm, excited sendoff

## Alternative Paths

### If Budget Was Higher (Message 4):
```
User: "We can go up to like 8k if it's worth it"

Vibi: "Okay love that! So with that budget we could do
Nobu or Zuma for sure. Both have private dining areas.
Nobu's rooftop room is honestly incredible for a special
birthday - does he like that kind of scene?"
```

### If He Didn't Like Asian Food (Message 5):
```
User: "He's actually more of a steak guy"

Vibi: "Okay steakhouse vibes! For that group size and budget,
Nusr-Et is fun for a birthday - it's a whole experience with
the salt sprinkling thing and they make a big deal of celebrations.
Or if you want less touristy, Beef Bar in DIFC is more classy.
Which sounds more like him?"
```

### If They Wanted Bigger Celebration (Message 2):
```
User: "More like 20-25 people"

Vibi: "Okay that's a proper party! For that size, we should
probably look at places with good standing space or outdoor
areas, not just a sit-down dinner. Are you thinking dinner
then drinks/dancing, or mostly focused on the meal?"
```
